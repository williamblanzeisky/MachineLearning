# MachineLearning
This repository includes all machine learning exercises I have done from mlcourse.ai. The datasets are provided by mlcourse.ai

- ExploratoryDataAnalysis: basic EDA for adult.data.csv (link to the dataset can be found in the .ipynb file and dataset is also attached in the folder. In this project, I explored demographic data (UCI “Adult”) using Pandas, Numpy.

- Data Visualization: basic visual data analytics using specific dataset attached in the folder. The main task is to eliminate features that will greatly contribute to the dependent variable by visualizing the independent features to the target variable. In this project, I analyzed cardiovascular disease data using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
